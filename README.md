- ### About Us
    
    Way Of Change Records (WOCR) is an independant hub focusing on the production and distribution of music and cultural works, utilising modern technologies to transcend artist-hostile conditions on modern platforms. We intend to enable artists by providing better profit-models on creative work and by recording and producing talent in our in-house studio.
    Our studio is the world's first purpose-built recording-to-blockchain venture.  Our expertise, equipment and studio construction combine to form a situation of no artistic compromises.  In this environment, creation is allowed to find its form.  The muse is with us. 
    Operating as a sort of futuristic record-label, WOCR occupies a unique spot in the world's musical landscape. It is the artistic arm of Sagebrush, which puts WOCR into a new category of musical entity. The days of centrally-controlled distribution are numbered,
