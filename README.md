  - About Us
Way Of Change Records (WOCR) is an independant hub focusing on the production and distribution of music and cultural works, utilising modern technologies to transcend artist-hostile conditions on modern platforms. We intend to enable artists both by providing better profit-models on creative work (through AdaSound etc.), and by recording and producing talent in our in-house studio.

WOCR makes up the artistic arm of Sagebrush Network and Research Group (SNRG), which operates a Cardano stakepool [1]
