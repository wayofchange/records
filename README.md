- About Us
    Way Of Change Records (WOCR) is an independant hub focusing on the production and distribution of music and cultural works, utilising modern technologies to transcend artist-hostile conditions on modern platforms. We intend to enable artists both by providing better profit-models on creative work (through AdaSound etc.), and by recording and producing talent in our in-house studio.

WOCR makes up the artistic arm of Sagebrush Network and Research Group (SNRG), building the internet of blockchain. SNRG operates a [[Cardano stakepool](https://cexplorer.io/pool/pool1dkpt0xwf0wzh0xzkqzxlyygznj9pt8pw6sdze7cs8tdd26hc3v2) and invites all [ADA](https://cardano.org/what-is-ada/)-holders to [delegate](https://cardano.org/stake-pool-delegation/) to it. This will support ongoing development in services that leverage blockchain technologies to empower creators.
