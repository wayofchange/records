  - About Us
Way Of Change Records (WOCR) is an independant hub focusing on the production and distribution of music and cultural works, utilising modern technologies to transcend artist-hostile conditions on modern platforms. We intend to enable artists both by providing better profit-models on creative work (through AdaSound etc.), and by producing local talent in our in-house studio.
